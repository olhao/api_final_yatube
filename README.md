> * to get, create, update and delete post/posts with IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly permission (get list of posts paginated with LimitOffsetPagination);
> * to get, create, update and delete comment/comments to post with IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly permission;
> * to get group/groups with IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly permission;
